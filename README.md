Low level I/O with MASM Assembly Language \n
In this program I implement low level input/output by taking user input numbers and converting them to their numeric values. I then show the user the numbers they entered by converting the numeric values back to strings. While in numeric form, I also calculate the sum of the numbers entered as as well as the rounded average of the numbers. The sum and average are also converted back to strings and displayed to the user. This program asks the user to input 10 signed values that fit inside of a 32-bit register. '+' and '-' signs may also be entered at the beginning of the numbers.
